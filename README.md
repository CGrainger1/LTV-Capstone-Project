# LTV-Capstone-Project

The project analyzes a full year of customer transactions, marketing spend, coupon usage, and product sales data for an e-commerce company. We compute customer Lifetime Value (LTV), segment the customer base, and generate insights to optimize marketing ROI, retention, and targeting strategies.

## Potential Insights & Business Applications
- Identify highâ€‘LTV customers for targeted loyalty campaigns.
- Discover underperforming segments for reactivation or special offers.
- Understand seasonal product trends to optimize inventory and promotions.
- Quantify ROI of marketing channels, and refine spend allocation.
- Test whether discount strategies drive incremental revenue or cannibalize margins.

## Business Impact
This analysis enables:
- Targeting high-LTV customers more efficiently
- Reducing churn by identifying risky segments
- Better budget allocation for marketing
- Smarter coupon/discount strategies to boost profits
